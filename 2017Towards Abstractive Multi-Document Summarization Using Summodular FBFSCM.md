> We propose a submodular function-based summarization system which integrates three important measures namely impor- tance, coverage, and non-redundancy to detect the important sentences for the sum- mary. We design monotone and submod- ular functions which allow us to apply an efficient and scalable greedy algorithm to obtain informative and well-covered sum- maries. In addition, we integrate two abstraction-based methods namely sen- tence compression and merging for gener- ating an abstractive sentence set. We de- sign our summarization models for both generic and query-focused summarization. Experimental results on DUC-2004 and DUC-2007 datasets show that our generic and query-focused summarizers have out- performed the state-of-the-art summariza- tion systems in terms of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 recall and F-measure.
